## About workout-tracker:

This application allows users to view, create and track daily workouts. They are also able to log multiple exercises in a workout (resistant and cardio training) on a given day. They can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they should be able to track the distance.

As a result the user will reach his/her fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.
